# TelegramFreak
This is a telegram bot is been created for learning&practicing python.

Bot already supports basic commands like /start, /help.

Final goal is to create a reminder that will send user a telegram message with user chosen text in user chosen time.

For that purpose I'll need to create a SQL database to store users&reminders, so I have to learn SQL too. Good luck me.
